description: Individually we did research about the problems that Wikipedia is facing. Together we discussed our findings and analyzed surveys. We identified accessibility as the main aspect we have to focus on in order to attract a wider and more diverse group of people. Only one of us edited Wikipedia before the project. So we tried editing Wikipedia ourselves and we were able to confirm our research findings. We created a list of requirements that we needed to work on in order to improve the accessibility. Based on these requirements we started to design our version of Wikipedia. Due to given time constraints, our main focus were the main page, the article page, the talk page, the history page and the user page.
