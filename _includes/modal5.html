                        <h2>Smartphone holder</h2>
                        <hr class="star-primary">
                        <p>I wanted to create a phone holder that fit the most common smartphones and not one that is
                          only designed for one phone in particular. I also wanted to be able to place the phone horizontally and
                          vertically in the holder</p>
                          <p>More generally I made this because I wanted a phone holder which was strong enough to support pressure
                            in order to enable the phone to be used while placed in the phone holder.
                            I discovered that many phone stands are designed simply to place the phone in it and perhaps play a video or music from it while placed.
                            Or just for the aesthetics. I wanted more functionality, and I wanted to be able to use my phone, browsing, scrolling
                            or viewing things while working at the computer. Hence why I created a phone holder which enables the user to interact
                            with it without the phone falling out of the holder or the holder tipping over itself.</p>

                        <p class="info-title">The holder was printed in four separate parts. The base, the back and two feet that elevates the phone.
                        I designed that holder with a hole at the bottom in between the feet, which in combination with the elevation
                        allows me to plug in my charger (can be seen in image 4 & 5).</p>

                        <p class="info-title">A serious shortcoming of our proposal is that core-Wikipedians
                         will most certainly be reluctant to implement our suggestions.
                        As we have seen with the visual editor it is very hard for the Wikimedia
                        foundation to propose changes to their user base.
                        We know therefore that it is quite unlikely that they will be
                        successful in persuading their users of a redesign of the platform.
                        However, we still decided to at least create an initial redesign concept to give
                        a clearer picture of what we mean by improving the accessibility of the site.
                        We believe that by lowering the technical barriers Wikipedia would be successful
                        in attracting a more diverse user group and that would benefit the society because
                        there would be a much broader knowledge for everyone available on Wikipedia.</p>
